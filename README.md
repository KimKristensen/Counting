# A countable service

## Technical choices
Counter REST service will be implemented in ASP.NET core.
Business logic service will be a written in C#

Data storage for backend will be mocked out...


## Progress
Rest service is running


## TODO
Counter should be increased with a number
Send post message as json object (counter, count)
Retrieve Get as json object (counter, count)
Error if getting counter that does not exist (as opposed to zero counter)
Timestamp on increment / decrement
Api project with http client
Business logic that counts

Some way of storing counters on backend
